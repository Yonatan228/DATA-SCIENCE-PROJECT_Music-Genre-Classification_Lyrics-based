# Music-Genre-Classification

In my final project of the Data Science course in my study, I chose to implement a NLP classification model to predict genre of songs based on their lyrics.


### Acknoledgement
I got the data from the brazilian website:   www.vagalume.com.br <br> 
A great website with plenty of lyrics organized by genre.

I got lyrics from the genres: Hip Hop, Rock, Reggae and Soul by building a crawler using the BeautifulSoup Python library.<br> 
I am following the basic steps of text classification:
* tokenization
* data cleaning
* vectorization
* model training
* test prediction
