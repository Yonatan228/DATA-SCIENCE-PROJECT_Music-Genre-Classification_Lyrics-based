# Music-Genre-Classification

Hello,

It took me quit some time to find an idea for my project in data science but i finaly decided to try building a word based machine learning model.
I thought about news topic classifier at first but music lyrics sounded more fun.


### Acknoledgement
I got the data from the brazilian website:   www.vagalume.com.br <br> 
A great website with plenty of lyrics organized by genre.

I got lyrics from the genres: Hip Hop, Rock, Reggae and Soul.<br> 
I am following the basic steps of text classification:
* tokenization
* data cleaning
* vectorization
* model training
* test prediction

I uploaded the notebook and the csv files containing the data.
